## Development Guidelines

### Daily Development Process
1. Start with a clear task from the current phase
2. Create a feature branch
3. Implement the feature
4. Write tests
5. Submit PR for review
6. Merge and move to next task

### Code Quality Standards
- Maintain consistent code style
- Write comprehensive tests
- Document all major functions
- Follow React Native best practices
- Regular code reviews

### Git Workflow
- Main branch: Production-ready code
- Develop branch: Integration branch
- Feature branches: Individual features
- Use semantic commit messages
- Regular merges to maintain sync

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for utilities and hooks
- Component tests for UI elements
- Integration tests for features
- E2E tests for critical flows
- Regular manual testing

## Success Metrics
- Code coverage > 80%
- App crash rate < 0.1%
- API response time < 200ms
- UI interaction delay < 100ms
- User session duration > 10 minutes

## Risk Management
1. Technical Risks
   - AI service reliability
   - Database performance
   - Native device compatibility

2. Mitigation Strategies
   - Implement fallback options
   - Regular performance monitoring
   - Comprehensive device testing
   - Regular backups and redundancy

## Regular Review Points
- Daily standups
- Weekly progress reviews
- Bi-weekly phase assessments
- Monthly roadmap alignment

This development plan is designed to be flexible and can be adjusted based on progress and requirements. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring a systematic approach to development.
